<p>v2.0.1 Added a small quiz into the game! If correct, you gain a huge lot of OP weapon! 16/11/2021
<p style="color:red;">Current issue:
<p>1.
<p>2 lag ping cause stuff act very slow. Actually i do not know how to fix this because of the massive amount of assets
<p>3 take a long time to join. This will not be fixed as i do not want people to join a benchmarking server... Everyone must be alone!
<p>4. Benchmark happens in a small place, sometimes won't even work.
<p>5. Due to lag,the instant complete tool do not break million asset instantly. If no lag, just 1 house can ultra laggy.
<p>6. Blur screen after activate instant complete tool seems too blury, if activate benchmark level at the same time it will be invisible to look
<p>7. Mini quiz containing 2 zeros, due to lag, sometime typing correct passcode will not open the door for some reason.
<p>8. OP gear last 1 time, so enable god mode if you do not want to lose them!
<p>9. terrain is weak, any of these weapon will make a giant hole. Without fly tool, it is impossible to travel!
