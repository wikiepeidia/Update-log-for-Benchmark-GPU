<p style="color:red;">Current issue:
<p>1.
<p>2 lag ping cause stuff act very slow. Actually i do not know how to fix this because of the massive amount of assets
<p>3 take a long time to join. This will not be fixed as i do not want people to join a benchmarking server... Everyone must be alone!
<p>4. Benchmark happens in a small place, sometimes won't even work.
<p>5. The insta benchmark tool will make CPU, GPU run at max speed instantly. This both erase and replace million of assets in just a small square within a second. An i7 CPU, GTX 1650, 16GB ram can take up to 3-5 minutes to display the next frame! (If roblox actually still work LOL)
