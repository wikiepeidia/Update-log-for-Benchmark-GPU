<p>v2.1  Remove the old benchmark tool as it acts not too well, replace it with better one. Secret level benchmark now inside a room with another code. It has display to show what code you entered! There is no clue shows what code is for the quiz and the door, find it yourself. The room  containing op weapon  no longer asking for button (sucks) now use your voice instead.
<p>2.1.1 Remove secret level benchmark due to i am making a new game designed only for this. The whole room still exists, but you will find some literally nothing. The game also stopped supporting, these bug won't be fixed and no more feature added.
  




<p style="color:red;">Current issue:
<p>1.
<p>2 lag ping cause stuff act very slow. Actually i do not know how to fix this because of the massive amount of assets
<p>3 take a long time to join. This will not be fixed as i do not want people to join a benchmarking server... Everyone must be alone!
<p>4. Benchmark happens in a small place, sometimes won't even work.
<p>5. Due to lag,the instant complete tool do not break million asset instantly. This lead to not much lag as I expected. If no lag, just 1 house can ultra laggy.
<p>6. Blur screen after activate instant complete tool seems too blury, if activate benchmark level at the same time it will be invisible to look
<p>7. Mini quiz containing 2 zeros, due to lag, sometime typing correct passcode will not open the door for some reason.
<p>8. OP gear last 1 time, so enable god mode if you do not want to lose them!
<p>9. terrain is weak, any of these weapon will make a giant hole. Without fly tool, it is impossible to travel!  Benchmark also cause holes but very small!
You guys suggest
